description: "After graduating with my bachelors in Exercise Science from Truman State University, I worked as a personal trainer and a soccer performance coach in St. Louis before coming to Mizzou to further my education and pursue my Masters in Exercise Physiology. I have always been interested in health and learning firsthand what steps I can take to live a healthier life. Outside of school, I enjoy reading, video games, playing and watching sports, chess, riding my bike and anything that gets me outdoors in nature."
