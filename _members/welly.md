description: "After earning my master’s in exercise physiology in 2015, I was offered the opportunity to continue with the department here at MU as a research specialist. In those 5 short years, I have helped with countless research projects and worked with over 2 dozen students in the lab. My favorite part about working for our department is the variety my job provides from conducting experiments to teaching undergraduates in the lab to collaborating with other researchers across campus, or even across the country. Outside of work, I enjoy working out (duh…ex phys), fishing, teaching my dog new tricks, kayaking, and volunteering as a dog walker."
