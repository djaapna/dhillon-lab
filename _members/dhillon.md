description: "Jaapna Dhillon is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology at the University of Missouri-Columbia. She received her PhD in Nutrition Science with a focus in ingestive behavior from Purdue University, an MS degree in Nutrition Science with a focus in community nutrition and dietetics from Syracuse University and a BTech degree in Bioinformatics from JUIT in India. Her current research examines 1) the effects of dietary interventions on cardiometabolic outcomes, gut microbiome, and multi-omics profiles, and 2) pre- and post-ingestive controls of food intake. Her research also integrates large datasets generated from dietary interventions into developing computational models that can predict metabolic responses to diets. Dr. Dhillon received the K99/R00 award from NIMHD in 2018 to 1) examine the effects of a functional food-based personalized diet on cardiometabolic and metabolomics outcomes in young adults at risk for metabolic disorders, and 2) assess whether improvements in diet will influence racial/ethnic underrepresented groups differentially than non-Hispanic Whites. She recently joined the American Society of Nutritionâ€™s Research Task Force."
