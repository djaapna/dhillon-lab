description: "I am an undergraduate at the University of Missouri. I am studying Biological Sciences, planning to attend medical school after I graduate. In my free time I enjoy watching movies and volunteering at my local hospital back home. What I enjoy about research is that it challenges you to test new ideas and possibilities."
